# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains my analysis and machine learning models for the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic machine learning problem where we predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features like age, gender, ticket class, etc.

## Files Description

### Data Files
- `titanic/train.csv` - Training dataset with survival information
- `titanic/test.csv` - Test dataset for predictions
- `titanic/gender_submission.csv` - Sample submission file

### Analysis Files
- `titanic/titanic_analysis.ipynb` - Exploratory data analysis
- `titanic/simple_csv_viewer.ipynb` - Data visualization notebook
- `titanic/analyze_predictions.py` - Script to analyze model predictions

### Model Files
- `titanic/titanic_ml_model.py` - Main machine learning model implementation
- `titanic/titanic_ml_model.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook version of the model
- `titanic/accuracy_verification.py` - Script to verify model accuracy

### Utility Files
- `titanic/create_notebook.py` - Script to create Jupyter notebooks
- `titanic/simple_csv_viewer.py` - Simple CSV viewer utility
- `titanic/view_csv.py` - CSV viewing utility

### Output Files
- `titanic/titanic_predictions_gradient_boosting.csv` - Model predictions
- `titanic/titanic_predictions_gradient_boosting.csv.zip` - Compressed predictions file

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
3. Run the analysis notebooks or Python scripts

## Model Performance

The gradient boosting model achieves competitive performance on the Titanic dataset.
